In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up a home lab environment. We'll use [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) to manage virtual machines and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to automate configuration.

## Why build a homelab?

A homelab allows you to experiment with new technologies, practice deployments, and host services for personal use. It’s a great way to learn about virtualization, networking, and infrastructure.

## Steps

1. Install Proxmox on your hardware.
2. Create virtual machines for different services.
3. Write Ansible playbooks to configure and provision your VMs.
4. Automate regular tasks and updates.

By the end of this project you’ll have a functioning homelab that you can extend with additional services such as a media server, file storage, or a Kubernetes cluster.
