Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) help you deliver code faster and more reliably. GitHub Actions provides a flexible way to automate your workflow.

## Getting started

- Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
- Define a workflow file to build and test your application.
- Add a deployment step to publish your application when changes are merged.

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

By adopting CI/CD, you reduce manual work and ensure that your application is always in a deployable state.
